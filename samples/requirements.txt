Project Requirements: Simple Calculator

Objective:
Create a simple calculator program that can perform basic arithmetic operations.

Functional Requirements:
1. Implement four basic operations:
   - Addition
   - Subtraction
   - Multiplication
   - Division

2. The program should:
   - Accept two numbers as input
   - Accept an operation symbol (+, -, *, /)
   - Return the result of the calculation
   - Handle division by zero gracefully

3. Code Structure:
   - Use functions to organize code
   - Implement separate functions for each operation
   - Include a main calculation dispatcher function

4. Error Handling:
   - Validate operation symbols
   - Check for division by zero
   - Provide meaningful error messages

5. Testing:
   - Include test cases demonstrating each operation
   - Show example calculations in the main function

Expected Output Format:
- Display calculation results clearly
- Use format: "a operation b = result"
- Example: "5 + 3 = 8"
